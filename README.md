My geostatistic project of fake geological deposit

The density parameter for individual layers (1-4) was analyzed. Two methods were used for the analysis, namely ordinary kriging and IPD (Inverse Distance Weighted).

The analysis of the obtained data indicates significant differences in density values between the studied layers. Layer 1 is characterized by higher density values (average density of 1.49 Mg/m3), while layer 4 has lower density (average density of 1.12 Mg/m3). This suggests diverse geological properties and composition of the individual layers of the deposit. The overall average density for the entire deposit, considering all studied layers, is 5.22 Mg/m3. This suggests that the combined density properties of the deposit are a result of a combination of different layers, with the higher density layers dominating.

The average kriging variance values for density differ depending on the examined layer. Layer 1 is characterized by a higher variance value (0.089527), indicating greater density variation in this layer. Layer 4 has a lower variance value (0.000204), suggesting less density variation in this layer. Layer 4 has the lowest average density of 1.13 Mg/m3 among all layers.

The total volume and mass values for layers 1 and 2 are higher than those for layers 3 and 4. This indicates potentially larger resource reserves in layers 1 and 2 compared to layers 3 and 4. The density in layer 4 is significantly lower than in the other layers, indicating the presence of lightweight materials or porosity in this layer, possibly brown coal.

The differences in densities between the studied layers and the variability in volume and mass suggest a complex structure and composition of the geological deposit. This may have significant implications for further geological, economic, and mining analysis.
